                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p><strong> Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro</strong> was born in São 
                    Pedro, Funchal, on the island of Madeira, Portugal, and grew up i
                    n Santo António, Funchal. He is the fourth and youngest 
                    child of Maria Dolores dos Santos Aveiro (b. 1954), a cook, and 
                    José Dinis Aveiro (1953–2005), a municipal gardener and a part-time
                    kit man. His second given name, "Ronaldo", was chosen after
                    then-U.S. president Ronald Reagan. His great-grandmother 
                    on his father's side, Isabel da Piedade, was from the island of 
                    São Vicente, Cape Verde. He has one older brother, Hugo
                    , and two older sisters, Elma and Liliana Cátia "Katia" , 
                    who is a singer. Ronaldo grew up in a Catholic and impoverished
                    home, sharing a room with all his siblings.
                <br>
                <br>
                    As a child, Ronaldo played for amateur team Andorinha from 1992 to
                    1995, where his father was the kit man, and later spent two years
                    with Nacional. In 1997, aged 12, he went on a three-day trial with
                     Sporting CP, who signed him for a fee of £1,500.
                      He subsequently moved from Madeira to Alcochete, near Lisbon,
                       to join Sporting's other youth players at the club's football
                        academy. By age 14, Ronaldo believed he had the ability to 
                        play semi-professionally, and agreed with his mother to cease his
                         education in order to focus entirely on football. While
                          popular with other students at school, he had been expelled
                           after throwing a chair at his teacher, who he said had "disrespected" 
                           him. However, one year later, he was diagnosed with a racing heart,
                            a condition that could have forced him to give up playing football.
                            Ronaldo underwent heart surgery where a laser was used to cauterise 
                            multiple cardiac pathways into one, altering his resting heart rate.
                             He was discharged from the hospital hours after the procedure 
                            and resumed training a few days later.</p>

                <h2>Sporting lisbo</h2>
                <p>At age 16, Ronaldo was promoted from Sporting's youth team by 
                    first-team manager László Bölöni, who was impressed with his
                     dribbling. He subsequently became the first player to 
                     play for the club's under-16, under-17 and under-18 teams,
                      the B team, and the first team, all within a single season.
                       A year later, on 7 October 2002, Ronaldo made his debut
                       in the Primeira Liga, against Moreirense, and scored two goals                       
                       in their 3–0 win. Over the course of the 2002–03 season,
                        his representatives suggested the player to Liverpool manager
                         Gérard Houllier and Barcelona president Joan Laporta.
                          Manager Arsène Wenger, who was interested in signing the winger,
                           met with him at Arsenal's grounds in November to discuss a possible transfer.</p>

                <h2>Manchester United</h2>
                <p>
                        Ronaldo became Manchester United's first-ever Portuguese player when 
                        he signed before the 2003–04 season. His transfer fee of £12.24 
                        million made him, at the time, the most expensive teenager in English
                         football history.Although he requested the number 28, his number
                          at Sporting, he received the number 7 shirt, which had previously been
                           worn by such United players as George Best, Eric Cantona and David 
                           Beckham.Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of 
                           motivation for Ronaldo. A key element in his development during 
                           his time in England proved to be his manager, Alex Ferguson, of whom 
                           he later said, "He's been my father in sport, one of the most important 
                           and influential factors in my career."
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Although his World Cup altercation with Rooney resulted in Ronaldo being
                     booed throughout the 2006–07 season, it proved to be his breakout year,
                      as he broke the 20-goal barrier for the first time and won his first Premier
                       League title. An important factor in this success was his one-to-one training
                        by first-team coach René Meulensteen, who taught him to make himself more
                         unpredictable, improve his teamwork, call for the ball, and capitalise on
                          goalscoring opportunities rather than waiting for the chance to score
                           the aesthetically pleasing goals for which he was already known.
                            He scored three consecutive braces at the end of December, against
                             Aston Villa—a victory which put United on top of the league—Wigan
                              Athletic, and Reading. Ronaldo was named the Premier 
                              League Player of the Month in November and December, becoming only
                               the third player to receive consecutive honours.

                <h2>Real madrid</h2>
                <p>Ahead of the 2009–10 season, Ronaldo joined Real Madrid for a world
                     record transfer fee at the time, of £80 million (€94 million).
                      His contract, which ran until 2015, was worth €11 million per year
                       and contained a €1 billion buy-out clause. At least 80,000 fans
                        attended his presentation at the Santiago Bernabéu, surpassing the
                         25-year record of 75,000 fans who had welcomed Diego Maradona at
                          Napoli. Since club captain Raúl already wore the number 7,
                           the number Ronaldo wore at Manchester United, Ronaldo 
                           received the number 9 shirt, which was presented to him by 
                           former Madrid player Alfredo Di Stéfano.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Ronaldo began the 2012–13 season by lifting the Supercopa de España, 
                    his third trophy in Spain. With a goal in each leg by the Portuguese,
                     Madrid won the Spanish Super Cup on away goals following a 4–4 aggregate
                      draw against Barcelona. Although Ronaldo publicly commented that 
                      he was unhappy with a "professional issue" within the club, prompted by
                       his refusal to celebrate his 150th goal for Madrid, his goalscoring
                        rate did not suffer. After netting a hat-trick, including two penalties,
                         against Deportivo La Coruña, he scored his first hat-trick in the Champions 
                         League in a 4–1 victory over Ajax. Four days later, he became the 
                         first player to score in six successive Clásicos when he hit a brace in
                          a 2–2 draw at Camp Nou. His performances in 2012 again saw Ronaldo
                           voted second in the running for the FIFA Ballon d'Or, finishing runner
                           -up to four-time winner Messi.

                <h2>Juventus</h2>
                <p>Ronaldo won his first trophy with the club in January 2019, the 2018 
                    Supercoppa Italiana, after he scored the game-winning and only goal 
                    from a header against A.C. Milan. On 10 February, Ronaldo 
                    scored and provided an assist for Emre Can in a 3–0 away win over Sassuolo;
                     this was the ninth consecutive away game in which he had scored for 
                    Juventus in the league, which enabled him to equal Giuseppe Signori's single 
                    season Serie A record of most consecutive away games with at least one goal.
                     On 12 March, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 3–0 home win against
                     Atlético Madrid in the second leg of the Champions League round of 16, helping 
                     Juventus overcome a two goal deficit to reach the quarter-finals. The
                      following month, Ronaldo scored his 125th goal in the competition, opening 
                      the scoring in a 1–1 away draw in the first leg of Juventus' quarter-final
                       against Ajax, on 10 April. In the second leg in Turin on 16 April, 
                       he scored the opening goal of the match in the first half, but Juventus
                        eventually lost the match 2–1, and were eliminated from the competition.</p>

                <h2>National team</h2>
                <p>
                        In Portugal's first knockout match, Ronaldo's only attempt on goal was parried
                         by Croatia's goalkeeper into the path of Ricardo Quaresma, whose finish then 
                         secured a 1–0 victory late in extra time. After his team progressed past
                          Poland on penalties, Ronaldo became the first player to participate in
                           three European Championship semi-finals; he scored the opening goal and
                            assisted a second in a 2–0 win against Wales, equaling Michel Platini as the
                             competition's all-time top scorer with nine goals. In the final against
                              hosts France, Ronaldo was forced off after just 25 minutes following a
                               challenge from Dimitri Payet. After multiple treatments and attempts to
                                play on, he was stretchered off the pitch and replaced by Quaresma.
                                 During extra time, substitute Eder scored in the 109th minute to earn
                                  Portugal a 1–0 victory. As team captain, Ronaldo later lifted the
                                   trophy in celebration of his country's first-ever triumph in a major
                                    tournament. He was awarded the Silver Boot as the joint second-highest
                                     goalscorer, with three goals and three assists, and was named to the
                                      team of the tournament for the third time in his career.

                <p>
                        As his reputation grew from his time at Manchester United, Ronaldo has signed many
                         sponsorship deals for consumer products, including sportswear, football boots 
                         (since November 2012 Ronaldo has worn the Nike Mercurial Vapor personalized CR7 edition),
                          soft drinks, clothing, automotive lubricants, financial services, electronics and
                          computer video games. Ronaldo was featured as
                           the cover athlete of EA Sports' FIFA video game FIFA 18 and was heavily involved in 
                           the game's promotion. His 'Siiii' goal celebration features in the FIFA series,
                            accompanied with his own voiceover. He was also the face of Pro Evolution Soccer,
                            appearing on the cover in 2008, 2012 and 2013.

                <h2>wealth</h2>
                <p>Forbes has twice ranked Ronaldo first on its list of the world's highest-paid football
                     players; his combined income from salaries, bonuses and non-football earnings
                      was $73 million in 2013–14 and $79 million in 2014–15. The latter 
                      earnings saw him listed behind only boxer Floyd Mayweather, Jr. on the magazine's 
                      list of The World's Highest-Paid Athletes. In 2016, he became the first footballer
                       to top the Forbes list of highest-earning athletes, with a total income of $88                        
                       million from his salary and endorsements in 2015–16. He topped the list for
                        the second straight year with earnings of $93 million in 2016–17. Ronaldo is
                         one of the world's most marketable athletes: SportsPro rated him the fifth most
                          marketable athlete in 2012, and eighth most marketable athlete in 2013,
                           with Brazilian footballer Neymar topping both lists. Sports market
                            research company Repucom named Ronaldo the most marketable and most recognised
                             football player in the world in May 2014. He was additionally named in
                              the 2014 Time 100, Time's annual list of the most influential people in the
                               world. ESPN named Ronaldo the world's most famous athlete in 2016, 2017 and 2018</p>

                <h2>Charity</h2>
                    <p> is no secret as to why Ronaldo sports no tattoos which cover the bodies of the
                     other players of his generation. He regularly donates blood at a clinic in his home 
                     country of Portugal and would not scar his body with tattoo needles that might prevent
                      him from doing so. However, the first incident that opened his mind to the importance of
                       donating blood to people in need involved a teammate of his at his national team.
