                <p>Ronaldo's father, José, died of an alcoholism-related liver condition at age
                     52 in September 2005 when Ronaldo was 20. Ronaldo has said that he 
                     does not drink alcohol, and he received libel damages over a Daily Mirror
                      article that reported him drinking heavily in a nightclub while recovering from
                       an injury in July 2008. His mother, Dolores, was diagnosed with breast cancer 
                       in 2007 but eventually recovered.
